# Spec: Program Generator (Structural Scaffolding)

**Status**: Implemented
**Domain**: Training Engine

## Open Issues

- [ ] **Scheduled programs have no mid-cycle deloads.** `isDeloadWeek(weekNumber, totalWeeks)` returns `true` only when `weekNumber === totalWeeks`. For a 12-week program, weeks 1-11 are all training — the lifter gets no programmed recovery week until week 12. This diverges from standard periodization practice (deload every 3-4 weeks) and from the unending generator (every 4th week). Options:
  - Align with unending: mark `weekNumber % 4 === 0` as deload in scheduled mode too, plus the final week
  - Keep current behaviour but clamp `totalWeeks` to a range where this is defensible (≤ 6)
  - Make deload cadence a formula-config parameter
- [ ] **Dead duplicate function `generateAuxiliaryAssignments` in `program-generator.ts`.** The same-named exported function exists in `auxiliary/auxiliary-rotator.ts` with a different signature (`programId, totalWeeks, pool, startOffset`). Because `modules/auxiliary/index.ts` exports after `modules/program-generation/index.ts`, the auxiliary-rotator version wins and the `program-generator.ts` version is unreachable. Delete the dead export to remove the name collision.
- [ ] **Future flexibility: generalize past squat/bench/deadlift.** `LIFTS` is hardcoded to `['squat', 'bench', 'deadlift']` throughout the engine (scheduler CUBE rotation, warmup presets, exercise catalog, volume mapping). Expanding to Hyrox / conditioning / accessory-only cycles requires generalizing the Lift enum into a program-type-scoped lift set and factoring the Cube rotation matrix into program-type strategies. Not urgent — strength training is the stated focus — but note the expected refactor surface before more generators are wired in.

## What This Covers

The `generateProgram` function now creates **structural scaffolding only** — session placeholders with metadata (week, block, lift, intensity type, planned date) but **no `planned_sets`**. Sets are calculated JIT when the user opens the session.

## Tasks

**File: `packages/training-engine/src/generator/program-generator.ts`**

- [x] `generateProgram(input: GenerateProgramInput): GeneratedProgramStructure`
  - Input: `{ totalWeeks: number, trainingDaysPerWeek: number, startDate: Date }`
  - Output: program structure with sessions that have NO `planned_sets`
  - Pure function — deterministic from the same inputs
- [x] `generateWeekSessions(weekNumber, blockNumber, weekInBlock, trainingDaysPerWeek, startDate): SessionScaffold[]`
  - Each session has: `weekNumber`, `dayNumber`, `primaryLift`, `intensityType`, `blockNumber`, `isDeload`, `plannedDate`
  - `plannedSets: null` — explicitly null, not an empty array (signals "not yet JIT-generated")
- [x] `generateDeloadWeek(weekNumber, blockNumber, dayOffsets, startDate): SessionScaffold[]`
  - Same structure, `isDeload: true`, `intensityType: 'deload'`
  - `blockNumber` is the block the deload **follows** (week 4 deload → block 1, week 8 → block 2, final-week deload → previous training week's block). Keeps the JIT pipeline's aux-assignment lookup coherent.

**Type: `SessionScaffold`**

```typescript
interface SessionScaffold {
  weekNumber: number;
  dayNumber: number;
  primaryLift: Lift;
  intensityType: IntensityType;
  blockNumber: number; // deload sessions inherit the block they follow
  isDeload: boolean;
  plannedDate: Date;
  plannedSets: null; // always null; populated by JIT generator
  jitGeneratedAt: null;
}
```

**Auxiliary assignment generation:**

- [x] `generateAuxiliaryAssignments(totalWeeks: number, auxiliaryPool: AuxiliaryPool): AuxiliaryAssignment[]`
  - For each block (1, 2, 3) and each lift (squat, bench, deadlift):
    - Select exercises at pool positions `[(blockIndex × 2) % poolSize, (blockIndex × 2 + 1) % poolSize]`
    - Returns list of `AuxiliaryAssignment` objects to write to DB

**Integration test:**

- [x] 10-week, 3-day program → 30 session scaffolds (3 × 10)
- [x] All `plannedSets` are null
- [x] Week 1 sessions: squat/heavy, bench/rep, deadlift/explosive
- [x] Week 4 sessions: squat/heavy (block 2), bench/rep (block 2), deadlift/explosive (block 2)
- [x] Week 10: all 3 sessions `isDeload: true`
